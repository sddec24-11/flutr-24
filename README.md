# API Calls
For the API calls, the easiest way to visualize it is this tool - if the API is changed, I will need to update this

Open editor.swagger.io

Click the text on the left, ctrl-A and delete all of it so it's empty

Open the "SwaggerAPI.yaml" file and copy all and paste that into the left side of swagger

I promise this will make API calls easier to understand
